INSTALLATION GUIDE: Python, Streamlit, NumPy, and pandas

Step 1: Install Python

1. Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click on Download Python 3.x.x (latest version).
3. Run the installer:

Step 3: Install Streamlit, NumPy, and pandas

Now use pip to install the packages:
pip install streamlit numpy pandas

Step 4: Verify Installation

You can test if everything is installed correctly.

Run the following command to check Streamlit:
streamlit hello
This should launch a demo app in your browser.

To test NumPy and pandas, run:
python
Then type:
import numpy
import pandas
print("NumPy version:", numpy.__version__)
print("pandas version:", pandas.__version__)
Type exit() to leave the Python shell.
